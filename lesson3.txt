When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I will use remote repository when I am working with someone and so that
    we can callaborate effectively.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So that I can myself decide when to pull commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a clone of a repository in the github itself. They are used when
    you want to work on someone elses repository but do not want change his 
    repository.
    Clones are clones of a repository from remote to local or from local to 
    local. This is used when you want to work on your local computer.
    Branches are commit paths. It is used for experimenting with changes without
    effecting the main/master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You get updated with the latest correction that has been made to the code
    and then you can work accordingly.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    You can use e-mail to callaborate documents but this would be very ineffecient
    as it would take a long time and would involve many copy-pasting process.
    Git is significantly easier to collaborate on and is highly recommended.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Making changes directly in the master is like finalising a change or a feature.
    So, one should first make changes to a seperate branch so that code can be reviewed
    by people before it can be merged.
